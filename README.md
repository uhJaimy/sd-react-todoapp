# sd-react-todoapp
This is a small project for school, so I can learn the base of ReactJS!

# Features
Below you will see all the features I am planning to add! This readme file is copied straight from chatgpt, sue me.
## Add and Delete Tasks: 
Users can add new tasks and remove tasks from the list.
## Task Prioritization: 
Add an option to mark tasks as "high priority."
## Local Storage: 
Save the to-do list to local storage so that it persists across sessions.
